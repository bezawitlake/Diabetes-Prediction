#Diabetes Prediction Using Neural Network
This repository contains code for predicting diabetes using a neural network. The neural network is implemented using a deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow or Keras) and trained on a diabetes dataset.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the neural network is the "Diabetes" dataset. It consists of various health measurements (e.g., glucose level, blood pressure, BMI) and the corresponding diabetes outcomes (0 for non-diabetic, 1 for diabetic).

# Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome. If you find a bug or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
